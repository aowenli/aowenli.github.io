However, these reactive supports are prone to deterioration during catalysis, limiting the lifespan of the catalyst and their potential practical applications4. New strategies are needed to simultaneously protect reactive supports and surface metal species without compromising the inherent catalytic performance. Here we report a new strategy to augment the structural stability of highly active interfacial catalysts by using inert nano-overlays to partially shield and partition the surface of the reactive support. Specifically, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/gamma-Mo2N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of gamma-Mo2N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation. This strategy yields an efficient and highly durable catalyst for hydrogen production by methanol-reforming reaction with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading, exhibiting a record-high turnover number, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 and a notable apparent turnover frequency of 24,500molH2molmetal-1h-1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\mathrm{24,500}\,{\text{mol } }_{ { {\rm{H } } }_{2 } }\,{\text{mol } }_{ { \rm{metal } } }<^>{-1}\,{\text{h } }<^>{-1}$$\end{document}.

The so-called ""single-atom electron microscopy"" brings new opportunities to study the structure-property relationship in energy-related nanomaterials at the atomic scale. In this review, we will firstly summarize some recent advances in low-voltage STEM imaging and spectroscopy with single-atom sensitivity, including emerging techniques such as STEM-DPC imaging andin situSTEM, by using two-dimensional (2D) materials as model systems. We will then discuss the application of these single-atom electron microscopy techniques to more complex energy materialsviaspecific examples. These powerful and comprehensive capabilities of aberration-corrected STEM with single-atom sensitivity have proven to be invaluable for unveiling the origins of functionalities of energy-related nanomaterials and guiding the design of novel materials with desired performance.",null,"ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY",2020-08-28,null,"JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A",8,32,16142,16165,eng,null,null,null,null,null,10.1039/d0ta04918b,2050-7488,2050-7496,null,null,false,disclosed

Here a novel Cu2O nanoparticle film was synthesized by square-wave (SW) electrochemical redox cycling of high-purity Cu foils. The cathode afforded up to 98% Faradaic efficiency for electroreduction of CO2 to nearly pure formate under >= 45 atm CO2 in bicarbonate catholytes. When this cathode was paired with a newly developed NiFe hydroxide carbonate anode in KOH/borate anolyte, the resulting two-electrode high-pressure electrolysis cell achieved high energy conversion efficiencies of up to 55.8% stably for long-term formate production. While the high-pressure conditions drastically increased the solubility of CO2 to enhance CO2 reduction and suppress hydrogen evolution, the (111)-oriented Cu2O film was found to be important to afford nearly 100% CO2 reduction to formate.

Herein, we demonstrate a facile approach to prepare three-dimensional (3D) N-doped carbon with a sp(3)/sp(2) carbon interface derived from ionic liquids via a simple pyrolysis process. The tunable hybrid sp(3) and sp(2) carbon composition and pore structures stem from the transformation of ionic liquids to polymerized organics and introduction of a Co metal salt. Through tuning both composition and pores, the 3D N-doped nanocarbon with a high sp(3)/sp(2) carbon ratio on the surface exhibits a superior electrocatalytic performance for the ORR compared to that of the commercial Pt/C in Zn-air batteries. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the improved ORR performance can be ascribed to the existence of N dopants at the sp(3)/sp(2) carbon interface, which can lower the theoretical overpotential of the ORR.",null,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH",2019-10-14,null,"ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION",58,42,15089,15097,eng,null,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1002/anie.201907915,1433-7851,1521-3773,null,null,false,disclosed

Accordingly, it is of fundamental importance to determine the direct relationship between catalytic performance and metal-support interactions. Herein, we provide a quantitative profile for exploring metal-support interactions by considering the highest occupied state in single-atom catalysts. The catalyst studied consisted of isolated Rh atoms dispersed on the surface of VO2 nanorods. It was observed that the activation energy of ammonia-borane hydrolysis changed when the substrate underwent a phase transition. Mechanistic studies indicate that the catalytic performance depended directly on the highest occupied state of the single Rh atoms, which was determined by the band structure of the substrates. Other metal catalysts, even with non-noble metals, that exhibited significant catalytic activity towards NH3BH3 hydrolysis were rationally designed by adjusting their highest occupied states.",null,"WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH",2017-04-18,null,"ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION",56,17,4712,4718,eng,null,null,scientific_journal,null,null,10.1002/anie.201701089,1433-7851,1521-3773,null,null,false,disclosed

Here, we develop CoO-supported Rh single-atom catalysts (Rh/CoO) with remarkable activity and selectivity towards propene hydroformylation. By increasing Rh mass loading, isolated Rh atoms switch to aggregated clusters of different atomicity. During the hydroformylation, Rh/CoO achieves the optimal selectivity of 94.4% for butyraldehyde and the highest turnover frequency number of 2,065 h(-1) among the obtained atomic-scale Rh-based catalysts. Mechanistic studies reveal that a structural reconstruction of Rh single atoms in Rh/CoO occurs during the catalytic process, facilitating the adsorption and activation of reactants. In kinetic view, linear products are determined as the dominating products by analysing reaction paths deriving from the two most stable co-adsorbed configurations.
